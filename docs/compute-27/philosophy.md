# Philosophy of Bittensor AI and Compute-27

When we do something we improve our lives. It would be strange to make it worse :)

AI gives us new incredible opportunities in building a new world, but we still have to build that world. Can Bitensor and Compute-27 become the new Disney for realizing our dreams or will AI become a new nightmare? It depends on us and how we use the opportunities that have opened up to everyone.
