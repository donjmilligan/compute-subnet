### The lifecycle of a code AI completion

*Reliability*

"There is one area that, in my opinion, is often overlooked in software development: Reliability. More specifically, we need to ensure that our system not only works on paper, but that it also does not regress in functionality over time (this can happen by us pushing faulty updates or by the infrastructure failing us in production).

There are a few basics for reliability like unit testing and tracking production errors that every project should implement. Since we’re working with a very flaky environment though (the LLMs indeterministic nature), we’ve had to add a lot more safeguards though."
